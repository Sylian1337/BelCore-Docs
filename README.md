# 🧠 BelCore - Modern Dragonflight Modding Knowledgebase

Welcome to **BelCore**, the private GitHub repository dedicated to documenting all known methods of **modding World of Warcraft: Dragonflight**.

This is **not** a core distribution. This repository is a **comprehensive knowledge hub** for advanced modders working with the Dragonflight client and server — including everything from **model porting** to **UI editing**, **DB2/DBC manipulation**, and **game system scripting**.

---

## 📌 Purpose

BelCore exists to answer the question:  
> _"What can we mod in Dragonflight, and how do we do it?"_

Whether you're building custom expansions, tweaking game systems, or exploring retail client internals — this repo aims to provide clean, repeatable documentation for every technique we've uncovered.
